I wrote this in English in the end because the davenzi (David / Matteo) fanfics that I've read are all in english (there is no single, one, chinese, both traditional and simplied, davenzi fanfic in ao3 ~~because the chinese skam fandoms are so transphobe and focus on traditional attractive male characters but i really don't want to talk about this in here~~ so there is nothing i can do haha). You really don't need to read this if you don't know what davenzi is and also this is basically me losing my composure for reading fanfics (fanfics! they are great but, fanfics!!) that are not even written in my first language. There will be a lot of emotional writings and some abrupt self-revelation / -reflection and I can't believe I haven't stopped myself from writing it, I am so sorry.

Since this year Croatia released their version of Skam ("Sram"), there are probably now close to 10 remakes of it. Sometimes, as a youtube comment said, it is crazy how we watched the basically same storyline in different countries/languages over and over again. But still, the charms and sense of realistic attached to the stories and characters drove the fandom to just literally, "watch it over and over again".

I surely haven't seen all of the remakes but I don't think any other versions or character relationships will ever cast so many emotions in me, so I dare to call Druck as my favourite skam universe. The fact is, I love it so much and I unpopularly think that it's better than the Norwegian original version. I might be biased but from watching davenzi's storyline I actually realise the some parts of the canon evak story don't make sense at all and are partly triggering (not saying that the job of the drama is to present 100% healthy romantic relationship but), like how you fell in "love" just seemingly because someone looks like a model from seasonal lookbook and how you are not mentally fucked for all the apparently-not-okay shits happening in your family but it's okay you've got big handsome crush going on.

Not saying that davenzi story is just straight-up perfect, honestly, I also don't think just by saying "i love you and you have all the time in the world" can actually perfectly resolve all the traumatic exposure of being forcefully out as transgender and I really don't like it when the writers used david-being-outed as a plot to push davenzi relationship forward. But still davenzi plots made some  adjustments on the original evak stories that just made so much more sense and ticked the most emotional part of me (and probably all the davenzi writers on ao3). Out of many things, I truly love the part where they present the reasons of why they are attracted to each other, namely, it's because they understand each other (Matteo: ich fühle mich so *verstanden*) and more importantly, have fun with each other. They'd laughed, talked, escaped bus ticket controller, exchanged stupid details over video games, and filmed even more stupid videos of *getting up stairs*. All of these are so realistic and honestly, I don't think there is a better definition of love there. Because eventually if you are going to convince the audience that love exists between the characters, you cannot just write how good they look (because it only proves the point that you cast some really hot actors but not that their dynamics are convincing) or how horny they feel with each other to an extent that they'd fucked while covered with oil paint (ok now you know my opinion to the french remake), honestly it's not just fake but also such a false and unfair depiction of LGBTQ relationships. It's just like someone says that they are hesitant to acknowledge transgender rights but also can't stop talking about how beautiful Hunter Schafer is (she is ofc *gorgeous* but you know what I mean).

Now it's the point that I remind myself that this is a davenzi fanfics appreciation post because out of the around 20~30 works I've read on ao3, the proportion of amazing works is just crazily high. I truly felt grateful for these amazing writers for creating these beautiful stories, some of which even transcend the original stories and bring the characters to the fullest. I cannot imagine a better audience experience when you fell for a slash in a fictional work and there are these amazing people that have extended the life-course of them and make the relationship even more beautiful.

Up until now my fav works are these. I usually skip the ones when I find out that they don't have much originality in it and basically just remake the existing Druck plots with minor changes or change of background settings. But it's just a personal taste thing, i appreciate everyone that has contributed to the fandom world.

It's Hamlet, it's Matteo cast as Ophelia, it's got amazing writing... It's the best thing I've read last year, really.

davenzi in fantasy world can i ask for more.

Oh my goodness like, I never thought english can be this beautiful (even though ironically, I watched Druck because i wanted to practice german jdbnakehjfiowp). Considering the most stuffs I read in English is academic papers and beaurocratic things, I almost forgot that I can actually feel the beauty and emotions in this language. I am so, so happy that I can get to read these works and have stepped out of my comfy zone (i usually directly filter the chinese works out in ao3 tags and crawl back to my first language brain but you know what happened). fanfics are my escaping place and davenzi is by far the most beautiful corner of it.
